  about: `After being involved in numerous projects and companies, and confronted to many web-related technologies, I'm now delivering my about twenty years old knowledge to all communities that need it. Experienced speaker, I share my experience in various domains such as security, web-technologies, front-end development, privacyâ€¦

I run through the web in an endless quest for quality, innovation, and beauty of code. Passionate about web applications and the web platform, APIs, and webperfs, I teach, code, design, improveâ€¦
  
Because I'm convinced that the group is stronger than individuals, I always bet on Open source, communities, and diversity to make a better Web for future generations.`,
